NoteyIO Flutter

## Getting Started

To run the App:
 - Make sure the api is running otherwise the app will not function as wanted.
 - Build the app, be it in Android Studio(Recommended) or using the command line to build using XCode if installing in an iOS device (This can only be built on an Apple Device).
 - If the app does not connect to the api but the api is running, change the api endpoint to 127.0.0.1 or the ip of the server
